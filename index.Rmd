## Why

Unemployment  rate is the principal economic problem in Spain. Spanish regions have different kind of unemployment rate. Age and education are important variables in order to get a job.  It has sense  research their  unemployment rate evolution across the regions

[EPA microdata](http://www.ine.es/en/inebaseDYN/epa30308/epa_microdatos_en.htm) is the official survey to research labour market. It's a panel where the people have interviewed each 3 months. In each wave, around 170,000 persons answer the survey.

Previously we have calculated unemployment rate by region, age groups and education level for each period since 2008. You can see how to do for one particular wave in this [rpubs document](http://rpubs.com/joscani/unemplrate)

With this app we can explore how to change unemployment rate across the time and compare regions, including important labour variables like age and education.
